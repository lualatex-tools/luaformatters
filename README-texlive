luaformatters README for TeX Live
=================================

* The files
  - luaformatters.lua
  - submodules/*.lua
  must be findable in the search path and probably
  be placed below tex/lualatex.
* The .lua files in the documentation and
  documentation/examples directories should be stored
  together with the documentation in the doc subtree
  and *not* moved somewhere else, because they are used
  as listings in the manual and have to be reached through
  relative paths.
